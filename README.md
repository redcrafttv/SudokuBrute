# SudokuBrute
Sudoku bruteforce solver mini application with file input. Works by determining all possible values in a cell and then filling the cells with only one possible value. Then the cells with a unique value are filled. If there has been no new changes to the grid, the application considers the process completed

!!!IMPORTANT!!! This project is Work in progress and rolling-release. This means that it may or may not work depending on the time you check.

Code contributions are welcome

Next thing im going to do is: make this an executable with an interface for easier usage. also im going to start not only looking at collumns and rows but also at blocks
